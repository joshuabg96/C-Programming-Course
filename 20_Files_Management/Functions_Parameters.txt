We have some functions that work to create, read or manipulate text or binary files
some of that functions are the following:
fopen()                   Opens a file 
fclose()                  Close a file
fgets()                   Read a line of a file
fputs()                   Write a string in the file
fseek()                   Look a specific byte in the file
fprintf()                 Write in the file with format
fscanf()                  Input with format in the file
feof()                    Returns true if it reachs the end of the file
ferror()                  Return true if an error happens
rewind()                  locate the position pointer at the start of the file
remove()                  Erase the file
fflush()                  Erase the content of a file

We can open a file in a different modes, depending what we want to do with it
r                Read, the file have to exist
w                Write, if the file do not exist it is created, if it does, overwrite the content
a                Write at the end of the file, if it does not exist it is created
rb               Binary, to read
r+               Read and Write, the file have to exist
w+               Create a file to write, if it exist overwrite the contet
rb+              Binary, to update, read and write
