Graphs: are fundamental data structure in computer science and mathematics that represent
relathionships between objects. They consist of:
    - Nodes: Represent entities or points in the Graphs 
    - Edges: Represent the connection between nodes. They can be directed or undirected.

Types of Graphs:
    - Directed Graphs (Digraphs)
        - Edges have a specific direction (A -> B)
        - Used in models like flow networks or web page ranking
    - Undirected Graphs
        - Edges have no direction; relationships are bidirectional (A-B)
        - Example: Friend connections in social networks.
    - Weighted Graphs
        - Edges have an associated weight or cost.
        - Example: Road maps with distances or travel times
    - Unweighted Graphs
        - All edges have the same weight (or none)
    - Cyclic and Acyclic Graphs
        -Cyclic: Contains cycles (You can return to a node)
        -Acyclic: Has no cycles
