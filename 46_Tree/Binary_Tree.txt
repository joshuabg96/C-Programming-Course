Binary tree: is a type of hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children.
commonly referred to as the left and the reight child.

Key Characteristics:
- Each node has up to two children:
    - Left child
    - Right child
- Hierarchical structure: Starts with a single root node and frows downward
- Recursive nature: Each subtree of a binary tree is itself a binary tree

Types of binary Trees:
- Fully binary tree: Every node either 0 or 2 children
- Complete binary tree: All levels are fully filled except possibily the last which is filled from left to Right
- Perfect binary tree: All internal nodes have exactly 2 children and all leaf nodes are the same level.
- Balanced binary tree: The height difference between the left and right subtrees of every node is at most one
- Degenerate binary tree: Elevery node has only onw child, forming a structure like a linked list.
- Binary Search tree: A binary tree where
    - The left child contains values less than the parent
    - The right child contains values greater than the parent.
