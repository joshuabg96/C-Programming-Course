Main Memory:
    The memory is divided in many bytes that have a direction.
    It is divided in 3 sections
        Stack: It is reserved to stored local and temporal variables during the execution of the 
        function, it works as "Last in First Out" LIFO, that means that last variable added 
        will be first eliminated
        Heap: It is used to store bigger objects and variables or that will be needed more time
        Code Section: Where the code is stored
How to use the Memory
    All the variables that you create directly in the code, as int float, etc are static 
    and will be stored in stack memory.
    The main function and all the functions that you have created will be added in Code section
    Heap Memory is not organized and you have to request the memory when you are going to use it
    and as soon as you finish to use it, you have to free the memory.
