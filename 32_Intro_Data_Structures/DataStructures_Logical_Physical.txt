Physical Data Structure: They are called physical Data structures because this data structures
manage the memory and store information in the memory.
    Array: They are data that store the elements side by side in the memory and 
    it is located statically
    Linked List: They are data structures that every element contains a value and a pointer to 
    the next node in the list, this structures is not stored continuous, in other hand
    can be stored in differents memory allocations and linked by pointers.

Logical Data Structure: They are as the rules that you have to follow to get and set the data in 
Physical data structures
    Stack (Pilas) LIFO: Lineal
    Queues (Colas) FIFO: Lineal
    Trees (Arboles) : No Lineal
    Graphs (Grafos): No Lineal
    Hash Table:
