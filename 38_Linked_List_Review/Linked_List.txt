Array vs Linked list

Array is a structure that has some limitation as:
- You can not change the array size
- Data are stored sequencially in memory

to avoid this array limitations we can use Linked List.

Linked List types:
- Singly linked list: Each node has a link to the next node
- Doubly linked list: Each node has links to both the previous and the next.
- Circular Singly linked list: Tha last node is connected back to the fisrt node, forming a loop
- Circular Dobly linked list: Each node has links to both the previous and the next, and the last node is connected back to the first node, forming a loop

The node is the scential base for the linked lists it contains 1 data and 1 reference to another node
Every node can be stored at random memory location, so it is not necessary to have sequence memory data locations.

Head is the first node of the list
Tail is the last node of the list

The operations that a linked list can have are the following
CRUD Opreations:
Create
Read
Update
Delete
