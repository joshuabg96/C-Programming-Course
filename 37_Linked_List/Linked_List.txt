A linked list is a data structure that consist of a collection of elements, called nodes, where each node contains two main parts:
- The data: Information stored in the node
- The link: A reference or pointer to the next node in the sequence.

Exist four types of linked lists:
- Singly linked list: Each node has a link to the next node
- Doubly linked list: Each node has links to both the previous and the next.
- Circular Singly linked list: Tha last node is connected back to the fisrt node, forming a loop
- Circular Dobly linked list: Each node has links to both the previous and the next, and the last node is connected back to the first node, forming a loop
